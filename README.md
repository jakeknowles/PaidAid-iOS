# PaidAid-iOS PaidAid converted to iOS

Paid Aid is an Android Application that gives shopping a new feel. A friend of mine and I created this application 
and our main goal was to create a new way of shopping/receiving things. This app allows users to post shopping requests, 
pick up shopping requests, and in return, get a cash tip.

A Proposal, Mock- UI’s, User stories, and a video of the functionality we’ve implemented so far has been finished. 
We are planning on continuing with Paid Aid and bringing it to the market in the near future.
